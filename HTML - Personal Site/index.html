		<p>
			I am an ameteur programmer and co-founder of Prisma-Studios Software Lab.
			My main focus is on web application development, but I also spend time
			doing automations in python, linux scripts and contributing to javascript
			libraries. I am working my way through Khan Accademy's Computer Science
			course and hoping to study it as my further education. At the moment I am
			working on my skills as a fullstack engineer, learning front-end
			development. I currently use Microsoft Visual Studio Code as my editor but
			I use Vim as my editor for writing linux and automation scripts.
